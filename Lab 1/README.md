## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? The Kitchen.

When is it happening? When the person is wanting to satisfy their hunger or go for a late night snack. As they grab the snack they will be given postive reinforcement depending on their choose of snack or meal they choose. They can unlcok additional feedback for sustained good or bad decisions. On top of that can receive feeedback given on their cumaltive decisions throughout the week.

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? My roomates. Who else is there? Can also assume for the occasional visitor. Different types of visitors could include friends coming over for dinner, people visiting from outside of town and family.

_Activity:_ 
What is happening between the actors? 
The actor will be attempting to satsify their hunger with a range of snacks in the kitchen. The device is intnended to only be used by one person. Other people using the device will have no effect on the tracking of your own statistics.

_Goals:_ 
What are the goals of each player?
To satisfy their hunger by choosing a snack.


\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

 The device will be disguised as a record album with a person on it that will be looking over you as you decide what your midnight snack is. As a person interacts with the fridge the device will give them the appropiate feedback.

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*


## Part B. Act out the Interaction


\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The timing is going to be a little awkard at times. This could be fixed with a bunch of software and maybe a camera to detect objects, but that is out of scope for this project.


## Part C. Prototype the device

Throughout making the device some of the things accomplished were. Making the holes for the phone light to go through, eventually cleaning them up by using a lighter to get the loose frays off of the device. Next I attempted to make a pouch for the device but ended up just taping it to stay put during filming. After the phone was connected to the IP, it was secured in the record and we were ready to film.

## Part D. Wizard the device


\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

Github was not allowing me to upload all of my images so I have stored them in the following google drive.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

The Lights not being big enough for user to be influenced by when being judged by the device. Device not being in the appropiate spot to have an influence. The device seems underwhelming at times.The ratio of light to the whole device does not seem like a good form factor as well.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

Github would not allow me to upload my videos so I have linked a public google drive.

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Cooper McGuire Helped me setup the IP and Tinkerbell tool. Also delivered an Oscar performance in the interaction videos I filmed.


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

Postive feebcak recieved was about creativness and good interactions seen with the device. Consturctive feedback was mainly centered around the desciption of the device being poor and an unclear objective being written in my repository. Since then I have cleaned both of these sections up to make the device more clear in it's purpose and goal when interacting with a user.
