## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? The Kitchen.

When is it happening? When you want a sweet treat or a midnight snack.

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? My roomates. Who else is there? Will be staged in my apartment so hopefully only my roomates. Can also assume for the occasional visitor. Different types of visitors could include friends coming over for dinner, people visiting from outside of town and family.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors? The actor will be attempting to satsify their hunger with a range of snacks in the kitchen.

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). To satsify their hunger.


\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

The goal for the device is to provide positive and negative reinforcment to the user based on their diatery choices. The device will be disguised as a record album with a person on it that will looking over you as you decide what your midnight snack is. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The timing is going to be a little awkard at times. This could be fixed with a bunch of software and maybe a camera to detect objects, but that is out of scope for this project.


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 



\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

The Lights not being big enough for user to be influenced by when being judged by the device. Device not being in the appropiate spot to have an influence.
## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Cooper McGuire Helped me setup the IP and Tinkerbell tool. Also delivered an Oscar performance in the interaction videos I filmed.


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
